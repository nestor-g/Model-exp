# Model-exp


The goal of this Repo is to experiment with an end to end "Requirements Quality Assurance" Program.

This is to be built based on key NLP models and LLMs. 

The crux of the work is the following flow:

1. Take a requirement
2. Review it based on the key "writing a good requirement" targets, based on INCOSE and Nasa guidance
3. Review it based on a wider understanding of a product or database.
4. output the requirement, a suggested edited requirement, and a set of explanations based on the rubric from step 2 and step 3.
